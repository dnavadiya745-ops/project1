    <h2>About Foodie Hub</h2>

    <p>
        Foodie Hub is a college demo food ordering website developed using 
        <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. This project is designed to demonstrate 
        the basic structure, layout, and styling of a modern food-related website.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website provides information about different food items such as burgers, 
        pizzas, pasta, and sandwiches. It focuses on creating a clean user interface 
        where users can easily explore food options and understand the concept of 
        online food ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Foodie Hub is not a real commercial website. It is created only for academic 
        purposes to understand how food delivery platforms work and how front-end 
        technologies are used to design user-friendly web pages.
    </p>
